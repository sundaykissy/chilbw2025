        <h1>The Importance of Performance Feedback in Virtual Reality (VR) Training: A Table Tennis Coach Perspective</h1>
        <p>Abstract</p>
        <p>Advances in Virtual Reality (VR) technology have redefined sports training, offering a new modality for 
            athletes to prepare for competitions. This paper explores the coaching strategies used to train novice 
            table tennis players in VR. Through interviews with the coach and participant feedback, we identified key 
            strategies such as personalized feedback, table division, and a structured training regimen for skill 
            development in VR. Challenges include limited facial awareness and the absence of virtual cheering, 
            which impacted the coach’s ability to engage fully with participants. These findings offer valuable 
            insights into coaching strategies in VR environments, contributing to developing more effective and 
            engaging VR training systemssssss.</p>
